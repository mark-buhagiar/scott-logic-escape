      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The leader of each team should share his screen to allow everyone to
            follow along.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your time will start as soon as you click the start button below.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's probably a good idea to save images as you come across them.
            This will save you time down the line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you get to the very end for your final time to be
            recorded. Trust me, you'll know when you're on the final screen.
          </li>
          <li>Progress is saved as you progress.</li>
          <li>Each team is allowed 3 hints.</li>
          <li>
            If you run into any issues or would like to use a hint, please reach
            out to Laurence, James D, Chris or Mark B.
          </li>
